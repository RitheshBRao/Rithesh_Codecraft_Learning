can we declare class as private

Can we declare an abstract class without abstract methods

Dynamic Binding or Late Binding is:

  Connecting the method and the parameters

  Because of overridden method and the use of the appropriate method during execution

  Because of overloaded methods

  When formal parameters and actual parameters differ

 What is the order of access modifiers in JAVA ?

  private - protected - public - default

  private - default - protected- public

  default - public - protected- private

  private - default - public - protected


 Interfaces can contain _________________ and _____________________ and abstract classes can contain _____________________ ,  ______________________and at least ___  ____________________________________   __________________

  Variables, constants,abstract methods and non abstract methods

  Abstract methods,constants,instance variables, implemented methods and one abstract method
